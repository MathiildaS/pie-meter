# pie-meter
A JavaScript library for a visual progress meter that displays remaining value as an interactive circular pie on a HTML5 canvas.

## About
pie-meter renders a circular pie that gradually shrinks as you add values against a chosen base amount. Unlike traditional pie charts used for static data visualization, pie-meter is designed for scenarios where you want to visualize remaining capacity. This makes it perfect for budgets, storage usage, displaying remaining lives in games, calorie tracking and more.

The focus is on providing users with an immediate, visual overview of how much remains.

## Features
- **Consumption tracking**. Add values and watch the pie shrink.
- **Colour boundaries**. Set boundaries and colours for "warning" and "danger" zones.
- **Customizable styling**. Adjust appearance to match your style.
- **Dependency-free**. No external libraries needed.
